# GW-GRB-SED-and-LC-plotting
Analyzes and plots data from Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) simulations. It reads information from a FITS file, extracts relevant data, and generates plots for Spectral Energy Distribution (SED), Flux, and Lightcurve. Additionally, it checks if the SED is above sensitivity and estimates rough significance.
